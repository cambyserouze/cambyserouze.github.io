<h1 class="title">Quantum Markov chains</h1>
</div>
<p>In the most general case, a (discrete time, homogeneous) quantum Markov chain is defined as a couple <span class="math inline">\((\mathfrak{M},\mathcal{E}^*)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> is a von Neumann algebra, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}^*\)</span> a quantum channel, i.e. a CPUP map on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span>. In the classical case, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}^*\)</span> reduces to a classical Markov kernel on a functional space. Focusing on finite dimensions, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}={{\cal B}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> for some finite dimension Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> of dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and work in the Schrödinger picture. Then a quantum Markov chain can be defined as a couple <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is a finite dimensional Hilbert space, and <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> a CPTP map on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. Before studying the refined properties of quantum Markov chains and their relations with their classical analogues, we review the basic properties of quantum channels, and especially their spectral properties.</p>
<h1 id="spectral-properties-of-quantum-channels">Spectral properties of quantum channels</h1>
<p>We here review some basic results on quantum channels, and refer to <span class="citation"></span> for proofs and more details. For a linear operator <span class="math inline">\(T: {{\cal B}}({{\cal H}})\to {{\cal B}}({{\cal H}})\)</span>, one defines its spectrum as the set of complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\((\lambda {\rm{id}}- T)\)</span> is not invertible. In finite dimensions, this is equivalent to the set of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>’s for which there is an <span class="math inline">\(X\in {{\cal B}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    T(X)=\lambda X.
    \end{aligned}\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a positive map, then its spectral radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho(T):=\sup\{|\lambda|,~\lambda\in {{\rm sp}}(T)\}\)</span> satisfies <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\rho(T)\le \|T(\mathbf{1})\|_\infty\end{aligned}\]</span> If in addition <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is unital or trace-preserving then it has an eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=1\)</span> (indeed if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is unital, then <span class="math inline">\(T(\mathbf{1})=\mathbf{1}\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is trace-preserving, then <span class="math inline">\( T^*\)</span> is unital and the result follows from the fact that the spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is equal to the spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span>). That is, in this case <span class="math inline">\(\rho(T)=1\)</span> so that all eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> lie in the unit disc of the complex plane. Moreover, if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a (complex) eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (with eigenvector <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\lambda}\)</span> is also an eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (with eigenvector <span class="math inline">\(X^*\)</span>, just use the decomposition into Hermitian and antihermitian operators of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, as well as decomposition into positive and negative parts of a Hermitian operator, plus linearity and positivity of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to prove that <span class="math inline">\(T(X^*)=T(X)^*\)</span>). For any such superoperator <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, one can introduce a matrix representation <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\in \mathcal{M}_{d^2}(\CC)\)</span> with respect to an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert Schmidt inner product. Like every other square matrix, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> admits a <em>Jordan decomposition</em> of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \hat{T}=X\left(\oplus_{k=1}^K J_k(\lambda_k)\right) X^{-1},~~~~ J_k(\lambda):=\begin{bmatrix}
        \lambda       &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
        0     &amp; \lambda &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
        \hdotsfor{5} \\
        0       &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda
    \end{bmatrix}
 \end{aligned}\]</span> Where the <span class="math inline">\(J_k\)</span>’s are the <em>Jordan blocks</em> of size <span class="math inline">\(d_k\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(\sum_k d_k=d^2\)</span>) and the number <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of Jordan blocks equals the number of different non-zero eigenvectors. It is sometimes useful to subdivise each Jordan block into a projection and a nilpotent part so that we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{spec}
    \hat{T}=\sum_{k=1}^K \lambda_k P_k+ N_k,~~~~~ &amp;N_k^{d_k}=0,~N_k P_k=P_kN_k=N_k,\\
    &amp; P_kP_l=\delta_{kl}P_k,~{\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(P_k)=d_k,~ \sum_{k}P_k=\mathbf{1}.
    \end{aligned}\]</span> The number of Jordan blocks with eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is called the <em>geometric multiplicity</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, while either joint dimension <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k:\lambda_k=\lambda} d_k\)</span> is its <em>algebraic multiplicity</em>. If these two multiplicities are equal for every eigenvalue, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> is called <em>non-defective</em>. Non-defective matrices are dense (which is easily seen by perturbing the eigenvalues) and exactly those for which complete bases of eigenvectors exist. We can then write <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \hat{T}= \sum_k \lambda_k |R_k\rangle\langle L_k|,~~~\langle L_k,R_k\rangle=\delta_{kl},
 \end{aligned}\]</span> so that the right eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(\{R_k\}\)</span> and the left eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(\{L_k\}\)</span> are biorthogonal. Returning to the fact that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a linear map on <span class="math inline">\(M_d(\CC)\)</span> this means that in the non-defecting case there are biorthogonal operator bases <span class="math inline">\(\{R_k\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{ L_k\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\}\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    T(A)=\sum_k \lambda_k {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(L_k^* A)R_k,~~~{\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(L_k^* R_l)=\delta_{kl},
    \end{aligned}\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \forall k:~ T(R_k)=\lambda_k R_k
        \end{aligned}\]</span> The Choi-Jamiolkowski operator <span class="math inline">\(\tau=(T\otimes {\rm{id}})(|\Omega\rangle\langle \Omega|)\)</span> then takes the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \tau=\frac{1}{d} \sum_k \lambda_k \overline{L}_k\otimes R_k.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a trace-preserving map, then all right eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(R_k\)</span> corresponding to eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_k\ne 1\)</span> have to be traceless <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(R_k)=0\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> is a left eigenvector. Note that if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a quantum channel, then <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> is generally neither Hermitian (unless <span class="math inline">\(T=T^*\)</span>) nor is it necessarily non-defective. However the uniformly bounded norm of trace-preserving positive maps prevents eigenvalues of magnitude one (the so-called peripherical spectrum) fromhaving non-trivial Jordan-blocks (meaning <span class="math inline">\(d_k&gt;1\)</span>):</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be a trace-preserving (or unital) positive linear map. If <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is an eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda|=1\)</span>, then its geometric multiplicity equals its algebraic multiplicity, i.e. all Jordan blocks for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> are one-dimensional.</p>
<p>Define now <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                    &amp;\hat{T}_\infty:=\sum_{k:~\lambda_k=1}P_k,\\
                    &amp; \hat{T}_\Phi := \sum_{k:~ |\lambda_k|=1} P_k\\
                    &amp; \hat{T}_{\varphi}:=\sum_{k:~ |\lambda_k|=1}\lambda_k P_k,
                    \end{aligned}\]</span> from the spectral decomposition in and the corresponding maps <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty,~T_{\Phi},~ T_{\varphi}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be trace preserving and (completely) positive. Then <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T_\Phi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T_\varphi\)</span> are trace preserving and (completely) positive as well. More precisely, there exists a subsequence <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\lim_i T^{n_i}= T_\Phi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T_\varphi = TT_\Phi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty =\lim_N \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N T^n\)</span>. Similarly <span class="math inline">\(T_\Phi=\lim_N \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k:~|\lambda_k|=1}(\lambda_k T)^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The maps <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_\Phi\)</span> are projections onto the set of fixed points and the space spanned by the eigenvectors of the peripherical spectrum respectively. That is <span class="math inline">\(X\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> is in the range of <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(T(X)=X\)</span> and it is in the range of <span class="math inline">\(T_\Phi\)</span> iff for every <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> there is an <span class="math inline">\(n\in\NN\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\|T^n(X)-X\|\le \epsilon\)</span>. In other words the image of <span class="math inline">\(T_\Phi\)</span> is the set of operators for which recurrences arise.<br />
<br />
Remember now the definition of the resolvent of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>: it is an operator-valued function on <span class="math inline">\(\CC\)</span> defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    R(z):=(z{\rm{id}}-T)^{-1}
    \end{aligned}\]</span> The singularities of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> are exactly the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in finite dimensions. Hence <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is defined on the set which is the complement of the spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, called resolvent set. For <span class="math inline">\(|z|&gt;\rho(T)\)</span> the resolvent can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        R(z):=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{t}\frac{T^t}{z^t}.
                \end{aligned}\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(T^t\)</span> describes the discrete time evolution of a quantum (or classical) system this series implies that the spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is reflected in a peculiar way in the time evolution of expectation values: consider any <span class="math inline">\(\rho,A\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> and the sequence <span class="math inline">\(\langle A(t)\rangle {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(\rho T^t(A))\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t=0,1,2,\dots\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> represents an observable and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a density matrix evolving according to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\langle A(t)\rangle\)</span> is the expectation value at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-transform (or discrete Laplace transform) of the ‘signal’ <span class="math inline">\(\langle A(t)\rangle\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                    \LL(z):=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{t\in \NN_0}\frac{\langle A(t)\rangle}{z^t},
                    \end{aligned}\]</span> which converges for <span class="math inline">\(|z|&gt;\rho(T)\)</span> and can be defined in the interior of that disc by analytic continuation. Obviously the poles of <span class="math inline">\(\LL\)</span> are located at eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Note, however, that depending on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> not every eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> will gives rise to a pole of <span class="math inline">\(\LL\)</span>.<br />

<h2 id="irreducible-maps-and-perron-frobenius-theory" class="unnumbered">Irreducible maps and Perron-Frobenius theory</h2>
<p>Perron-Frobenius theory, roughly speaking, deals with the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of (element-wise) non-negative matrices. In this section we discuss the generalization of Perron-Frobenius theory to the context of positive maps on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span>. A positive linear map <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> is called <em>irreducible</em> if for any <span class="math inline">\(P\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> Hermitian projector such that <span class="math inline">\(T(P\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)P)\subseteq P\mathcal{M}_d(\CC) P\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(P\in\{0,1\}\)</span>. The following theorem gives equivalent characterizations of an irreducible operator:</p>
<p>[theorem6.2] Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a positive linear map. Then <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is irreducible if and only if any of these equivalent properties are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For very non-zero <span class="math inline">\(A\ge 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({\rm{id}}+T)^{d-1}(A)&gt;0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For every non-zero <span class="math inline">\(A\ge0\)</span> and every <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;0\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\exp(tT)(A)&gt;0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For every orthogonal pair of non-zero, positive semi-definite <span class="math inline">\(A,B\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> there is an integer <span class="math inline">\(t\in\{1,\dots, d-1\}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(BT^t(A))&gt;0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is irreducible if and only if the dual map <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is irreducible. If a proper projection <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> reduces <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in the sense that <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}((\mathbf{1}-P)T(P))=0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{1}-P\)</span> reduces <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span>. In order to relate <em>irreducibility</em> to spectral properties of a positive map <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> it is useful to consider the following functionals defined on the cone of positive semi-definite operators <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            &amp;r(X):=\sup\{\lambda\in\RR|(T-\lambda{\rm{id}})(X)\ge 0\},\\
            &amp;\tilde{r}(X):=\inf\{\lambda\in\RR|(T-\lambda{\rm{id}})(X)\le 0\}.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> We are especially interested in the maxima <span class="math inline">\(r:=\sup_{X\ge 0} r(X)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{r}:=\sup_{X\ge 0}\tilde{r}(X)\)</span> which obviously satisfy <span class="math inline">\(r\ge \tilde{r}\)</span> and actually coincide for irreducible maps:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be an irreducible positive map. Then</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the quantities introduced above <span class="math inline">\(r=\tilde{r}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a non-degenerate eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and the corresponding eigenvector is strictly positive, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(T(X)=r X&gt;0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is any <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;0\)</span> which is an eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with positive eigenvector, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(T(Y)=\lambda Y\ge 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\lambda =r\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the spectral radius of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to the simple observation:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be an irreducible map. Then for arbitrary constants <span class="math inline">\(c&gt;0\)</span> and invertible matrices <span class="math inline">\(C\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> the maps <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{sim}
                            T&#39;(.):=c ~C^{-1}T(C.C^\dagger)C^{-\dagger},
                            \end{aligned}\]</span> are irreducible as well.</p>
<p>The invariance of irreducibility under similarity transformations of the form [sim] shows that irreducibility does not only imply spectral properties of a positive map, but that it is determined by such properties:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a positive map with spectral radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. The following are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is irreducible.</p></li>
<li><p>The spectral radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a non-degenerated eigenvalue and the corresponding right and left eigenvectors are positive definite (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(T(X)=\rho X&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^*(Y)=\rho Y &gt;0\)</span>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we now consider the time evolution of a density operator of the form <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t:=T^t(\rho)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a positive and trace-preserving map and <span class="math inline">\(t\in\NN\)</span>, then the previous theorem allows us to relate irreducibility to a unique time-average corresponding to a full-rank stationary state:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a positive, trace-preserving linear map. Then the following are equivalent</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is irreducible</p></li>
<li><p>There exists a unique density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\sigma&gt;0\)</span> such that for every density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho \in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                \lim_N \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N T^t(\rho)=\sigma.
                                                \end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Irreducible positive maps are generic, and in particular they are dense in the set of all positive aps. For instance <span class="math inline">\(X\to T(X)+\epsilon \mathbf{1} {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(X)\)</span> is irreducible for every <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> and positive <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> since it maps every positive input to a positive definite output. By continuity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors we can therefore extend the above observation about the spectral radius to arbitrary positive maps:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a positive map with spectral radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is an eigenvalue and there is a positive semi-definite <span class="math inline">\(X\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(T(X)=\rho X\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>peripherical spectrum</em> is the set of eigenvalues whose magnitude is equal to the spectral radius, i.e. equal to one if we are considering unital positive maps. As we saw above, the properties of positivity and unitality together imply that all eigenvalues in the peripherical spectrum have trivial (i.e. one-dimensional) Jordan blocks. If we add irreducibility and the assumed validity of the Schwarz inequality we can say much more:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be an irreducible unital map which fulfills the Schwarz inequality. Denote by <span class="math inline">\(S:={{\rm sp}}(T)\cap \exp(i\RR)\)</span> the peripherical spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Then</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is an integer <span class="math inline">\(m\in\{ 1,\dots, d^2\}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(S=\{\exp(2\pi ik/m)\}_{k\in \ZZ_m}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>All eigenvalues in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are non-degenerate.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(k\in\NN\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(T(U^k)=\lambda^k U^k\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda:=\exp(2\pi i/m)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> has a spectral decomposition <span class="math inline">\(U=\sum_{k\in\ZZ_m} \gamma^k P_k\)</span> where the spectral projections <span class="math inline">\(P_k\)</span> satisfy <span class="math inline">\(T(P_{k+1})=P_k\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="primitive-maps" class="unnumbered">Primitive maps</h2>
<p>A <em>primitive map</em> is an irreducible positive map with trivial peripherical spectrum. Similar to the irreducible case primitive maps can, however, be characterized by a number of equivalent properties each if which may be used as a definition:</p>
<p>[6.7] Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a positive and trace-preserving linear map. Then the following statements are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There exists an <span class="math inline">\(n\in\NN\)</span> such that for every density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T^n(\rho)&gt;0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T^k\)</span> is irreducible for every <span class="math inline">\(k\in\NN\)</span> and the limit <span class="math inline">\(T_\Phi\)</span> is irreducible as well.</p></li>
<li><p>For all density matrices <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> the limit <span class="math inline">\(\lim_k T^k(\rho)\)</span> exists, is independent of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and given by a positive definite density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_\infty\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has trivial peripherical spectrum (i.e. counting algebraic multiplicities, there is only one eigenvalue of magnitude one) and the corresponding eigenvector is positive definite.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we interprete <span class="math inline">\(T^t(\rho)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t\in\NN\)</span> as a discrete time-evolution, then primitive maps are exactly those for which the evolution eventually converges to a stationary state which is strictly positive (i.e. it may in some contexts be interpreted as a finite temperature Gibbs state) and independent of the initial state. If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in addition satisfies the Schwarz inequality then we can replace the point [2] above by the statement that <span class="math inline">\(T^k\)</span> is irreducible for all <span class="math inline">\(k&lt;d^2\)</span>. Now if a map is completely positive, we can give three more equivalent characterizations of primitivity:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a completely positive and trace-preserving linear map with Kraus decomposition <span class="math inline">\(T(.)=\sum_i K_i . K_i^{\dagger}\)</span>. Denote by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_m:=\operatorname{span} \{\prod_{k=1}^m  K_{i_k}\}\)</span> the complex linear span of all degree-m monomials of Kraus operators. Then the following are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is primitive.</p></li>
<li><p>There exists an <span class="math inline">\(n\in\NN\)</span> such that for every non-zero <span class="math inline">\(\psi\in\CC^d\)</span> and all <span class="math inline">\(m\ge n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_m|\psi\rangle=\CC^d\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>There exists a <span class="math inline">\(q\in\NN\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(m\ge q\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_m-\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>There exists a <span class="math inline">\(q\in\NN\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(m\ge q\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((T^m\otimes {\rm{id}}_d)(|\Omega\rangle\langle \Omega|)&gt;0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\in \CC^d\otimes \CC^d\)</span> denotes a maximally entangled state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> appearing in [3] and [4] can be chosen equal and if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are chosen minimal, then <span class="math inline">\(n\le q\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact the numbers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> appearing in the last theorem can be bounded by the dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the system. These bounds can be seen as quantum counterpart to Wielandt’s inequality, which does the same for the classical case of primitive stochastic matrices:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be a primitive quantum channel on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> with Kraus rank <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Then for the minimal <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> as it appears in last theorem, we have that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In general <span class="math inline">\(q\le (d^2-k+1)d^2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the span of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_1\)</span> contains an invertible element, then <span class="math inline">\(q\le d^2-k+1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the span of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}_1\)</span> contains an element with a least one non-zero eigenvalue, then <span class="math inline">\(q\le d^2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fixed-points" class="unnumbered">Fixed points</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be a continuous map from a non-empty, compact set <span class="math inline">\(S\subset \RR^d\)</span> into itself, then there is an <span class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(T(x)=x\)</span>.</p>
<p>As the set of Hermitian matrices in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> is a real vector space and the density matrices therein form a compact, convex set, Brouwer’s fixed point theorem immediately implies:</p>
<p>Every continuous, trace-preserving, positive (not necessarily linear) map <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> has at least one stationary state. That is, there is a density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(T(\rho)=\rho\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the following we are interested in linear maps which are automatically continuous</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T: \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving, positive, linear map and <span class="math inline">\(X=T(X)\)</span> a fixed point. If <span class="math inline">\(X=\sum_{j=1}^4 c_j P_j\)</span> is the decomposition of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into four positive operators <span class="math inline">\(P_j\ge 0\)</span> which arises from decomposing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts and these further into orthogonal positive and negative parts, then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                            T(P_j)=P_j,\qquad j=1,\dots, 4
                                            \end{aligned}\]</span> are fixed points as well.</p>
<p>For a map <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> define the set of fixed points <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                        \mathcal{F}(T):=\{X\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)~|~X-T(X)\}.
                                        \end{aligned}\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is linear, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T)\)</span> is closed under linear combinations, i.e. it is a vector space, and if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is Hermiticity preserving (in particular if it is positive) then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T)\)</span> is closed under Hermitian conjugation. The previous proposition immediately implies that for trace-preserving quantum channels the set of fixed points is spanned by stationary density operators:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving, positive, linear map. If the space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T)\)</span> has dimension <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, then there are <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> linearly independent density operators <span class="math inline">\(\rho_a\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\}_{a=1,\dots,D}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(T(\rho_a)=\rho_a\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                \mathcal{F}(T)=\operatorname{span}\{\rho_1,\dots, \rho_D\}.
                                                \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving, positive, linear map and <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty\)</span> the projection onto its fixed point space. Then fixed point <span class="math inline">\(X=T(X)\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> has support and rance within the support space of the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(T_\infty(\mathbf{1})\)</span>.</p>
<p>The following shows that the ranges of all stationary states play an exceptional role: every state which is supported within such a space will remain so after the action of the channel:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving, positive, linear map and let <span class="math inline">\(Q\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be the Hermitian projection onto the support of any stationary density operator <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=T(\sigma)\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}((1-Q)T(Q))=0\)</span> and for every density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{statsub}
                                                    \rho\le Q\implies T(\rho)\le Q.
                                                    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Projections onto stationary subspaces in the sense of [statsub] can be easily characterized in the Heisenberg picture as well:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving, positive, linear map, and let <span class="math inline">\(Q\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be any Hermitian projection. Then the following statements are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For every density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\rho\le Q\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(T(\rho)\le Q\)</span> as well,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T^*(Q)\ge Q\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A projection onto a stationary subspace is often called <em>sub-harmonic</em> and item [2] of last proposition is used as the defining property of this notion. Note that while the support projection of every stationary state is sub-harmonic, the converse is not necessarily true: for instance <span class="math inline">\(T^*(\mathbf{1})\ge \mathbf{1}\)</span> hlds trivially for every trace-preserving <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> even if there is no stationary state of full rank. If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is completely positive with Kraus decomposition <span class="math inline">\(T(.)=\sum_i K_i . K_i^\dagger\)</span> one can relate support spaces of fixed points to properties of the Kraus operators: suppose there is a stationary state with support <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\in\CC^d\)</span>. Then all Kraus operators have to preserve this subspace in the sense that <span class="math inline">\(K_i{{\cal H}}\subseteq {{\cal H}}\)</span>. In particular if <span class="math inline">\(\rho-|\psi\rangle\langle \psi|\)</span> is a pure state, then <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> has to be a simultaneous eigenvector of all Kraus operators. We now investigate the structure of the set of fixed points of quantum channels. First characterize the fixed point set of unital maps which hae a dual with fixed point of full rank:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T^*:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a unital map which (i) satisfies the Schwarz inequality, and (ii) is such that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has a full rank fixed point. Then the set of fixed points <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T^*)\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-algebra.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> does not have a full rand fixed point, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T^*)\)</span> need not be an algebra. We can still obtain a weaker structure in this case:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T^*\\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a unital linear map which satisfies the Schwarz inequality. Let <span class="math inline">\(Q=Q^\dagger\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be the projection onto the maximum rank fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, then the following set is a <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-algebra: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                                \{Y\in Q\mathcal{M}_d(\CC) Q~|~ QT^*(Y)Q=Y\}.
                                                                \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The relation between fixed point sets of unital maps and <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-algebras becomes more transparent for completely positive maps:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T^*:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a completely positive unital map with Kraus decomposition <span class="math inline">\(T^*(.)=\sum_i K_i^\dagger . K_i\)</span>. If both <span class="math inline">\(X,X^\dagger X\in\mathcal{F}(T^*)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\([X,K_i]=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Consequently the largest <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-subalgebra contained within <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T^*)\)</span> is given by the set <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                    \{ X\in\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)~|~ \forall i~ [X,K_i]=[X,K_i^\dagger]=0\}.
                                                    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Finally we can discuss the structire of the fixed point set of trace-preserving maps</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving positive linear map for which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> satisfies the Schwarz inequality. Then there is a unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> and a set of positive definite density matrices <span class="math inline">\(\rho_k\in \mathcal{M}_{m_k}(\CC)\)</span> such that the fixed point set of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                            \mathcal{F}(T)=U\left( 0\oplus \bigoplus_{k=1}^K\mathcal{M}_{d_k}(\CC)\otimes \rho_k\right)U^\dagger,
                                                            \end{aligned}\]</span> for an appropriate decomposition of the Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(\CC^d=\CC^{d_0}\oplus \bigoplus \CC^{d_k}\otimes \CC^{m_k}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The set of fixed points is closely related to a <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-algebra (actually is a <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-algebra w.r.t. a modified product):</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving, positive linear map for which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> satisfies the Schwarz inequality. Then for any density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> which isa maximum rank fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> we have that the set <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{-1/2}\mathcal{F}(T) \rho^{-1/2}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>-algebra (with the inverse taken on the support of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving quantum channel with Kraus decomposition <span class="math inline">\(T(.)= K_i . K_i^\dagger\)</span>. If for some <span class="math inline">\(n\in\NN\)</span> we have that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                                \operatorname{span}\left( \prod_{k=1}^n K_{i_k}\right)=\mathcal{M}_d(\CC),
                                                                \end{aligned}\]</span> i.e. homogeneous polynomials of the Kraus operators span the entire matrix algebra, then there exist a unique positive definite matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(T)\propto \rho\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally the following theorem gives a characterization of the space corresponding to the peripherical spectrum <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                                        \mathcal{X}(T):=\operatorname{span}\{ X\in \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)~|~\exists\varphi\in \RR:~T(X)=\e^{i\varphi X}.
                                                        \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T:\mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\to \mathcal{M}_d(\CC)\)</span> be a trace-preserving and positive linear map which fulfills the Schwarz inequality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There exists a decomposition of the Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(\CC^d={{\cal H}}_0\oplus \bigoplus_{k=1}^K {{\cal H}}_k\)</span> into a direct sum of tensor products <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}_k= {{\cal H}}_{k,1}\otimes {{\cal H}}_{k,2}\)</span> and positive definite density matrices <span class="math inline">\(\rho_k\)</span> acting on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}_{k,2}\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

</ul>
<h1 id="quantum-markov-chains-the-general-framework">Quantum Markov Chains: the general framework</h1>
<p>Discrete-time quantum Markov chains have been introduced and studied in <span class="citation"></span>. The idea here is to replace the classical state space by a Hilbert space and the transition probability matrix by a superoperator, which is a mathematical formalism of the discrete-time evolution of open quantum systems. A <em>quantum Markov chain</em> is a pair <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is a Hilbert space, and <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> is a super-operator on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. We assume here for the sake of simplicity that <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is finite-dimensional. We use <span class="math inline">\({{\cal B}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\cal D}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> to denite the linear operators acting on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> and the set of density operators in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>, respectively. We recall that the support of a density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}(\rho)\)</span>, is the subspace of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> spanned by the eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues. The image subspaces <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> under a superoperator <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> is defined to be <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    {{\cal E}}(X):=\bigvee_{|\Phi\rangle\in X} {\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}(|\Phi\rangle\langle \Phi|)).
    \end{aligned}\]</span> The <em>reachable space</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is defined to be <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{R}_{({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})}(\rho):= \bigvee_{i=0}^\infty {\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^i(\rho)).
        \end{aligned}\]</span> Intuitively, as its name suggests, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_{({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})}(\rho)\)</span> consists of all states that can be reached from the initial state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> in the iterative evolution of the system modeled by <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span>. In fact it was shown in <span class="citation"></span> that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{finite}
\mathcal{R}_{({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})}(\rho)= \bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1} {\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^i(\rho)).
                    \end{aligned}\]</span> For a quantum Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span> a state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in{{\cal D}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> is called a <em>stationary state</em> if <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}(\rho)=\rho\)</span>; that is <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a fixed point of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span>. We also define the restriction of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> on the subspace <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}|_X\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}|_X(\rho)=P_X {{\cal E}}(\rho)P_X\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in{{\cal D}}(X)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P_X\)</span> is the projector onto <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. A subspace <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is called <em>strongly connected</em> in <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span> if for any <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle, |\psi\rangle\in X\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle  \in \mathcal{R}_{({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})}(|\psi\rangle\langle \psi|)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle  \in \mathcal{R}_{({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})}(|\phi\rangle\langle \phi|)\)</span>; that is <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle,|\psi\rangle\)</span> can be reached from another one. Let <span class="math inline">\(SC({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span> be the set of all strongly connected subspaces of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span>. It is easy to see that the partial order <span class="math inline">\((SC({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E}),\subseteq)\)</span> is inductive. Then Zorn’s lemma asserts that it has maximal elements. Each maximal element of <span class="math inline">\((SC({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E}),\subseteq)\)</span> is called a <em>strongly connected component</em> (SCC) of <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span>. A subspace <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is called a <em>bottom strongly connected component</em> (BSCC) of <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span> if it is a SCC and <em>invariant</em> in <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}(X)\subseteq X\)</span>. Finally a subspace <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is called <em>transient</em> if for any <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in{{\cal D}}({{\cal H}})\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                    \lim_n {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(P_X {{\cal E}}^n(\rho))=0,

Intuitively, this means that the system will eventually go out of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> no matter where it starts from. The following theorem shows that a quantum Markov chain can be decomposed into a family of BSCC’s together with a transient subspace</p>
<p>For any quantum Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<h2 id="irreducibility-and-periodicity" class="unnumbered">Irreducibility and periodicity</h2>
<p>Recall from classical probability theory that an irreducible Markov chain starting from a state <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can reach any other state <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in a finite number of steps. The notion of irreducibility can be straightforwardly extended to quantum Markov chains using the concept of reachable space introduced above: a quantum Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})\)</span> is called <em>irreducible</em> if for any <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in {{\cal D}}({{\cal H}})\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}_{({{\cal H}},\mathcal{E})}(\rho)={{\cal H}}\)</span>. This definition of irreducibility is equivalent to the one we gave above (see and ), but this new definition serves as a more natural extension of irreducibility for classical Markov chains. <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> is irreducible if and only if <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> itseld is a BSCC of <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span>. Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> has a unique BSCC <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> if and only if it has a unique stationary state <span class="math inline">\(\rho^*\)</span>, and in that case, <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}(\rho^*)=B\)</span>. As a Corollary, <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> is irreducible if and only if is has a unique stationary state <span class="math inline">\(\rho^*\)</span> with support <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>.<br />
<br />
We now move towards the notion of periodicity. A state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is called <em>aperiodic</em> if <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                        \text{gcd}\{m\ge 1~:~ {\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}(\rho)\subseteq {\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^m(\rho))\}=1.
                        \end{aligned}\]</span> A subspace <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is <em>aperiodic</em> if each operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}(\rho)\subseteq X\)</span> is aperiodic. If there exists an integer <span class="math inline">\(d\ge 1\)</span> such that the whole state space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is aperiodic in <span class="math inline">\((({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}}^d))\)</span>, then the minimum of such integers <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(d({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span>, is called the <em>period</em> of <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(d(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}}))=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> is said to be <em>aperiodic</em>, otherwise, it is <em>periodic</em>. The notion of periodicity was already defined in <span class="citation"></span> based on the notion of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span>-cyclic resolution: for a Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> let <span class="math inline">\((P_0,\dots,P_{d-1})\)</span> be a resolution of identity, i.e. a family of orthogonal projectors such that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} P_k=I\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\((P_0,\dots , P_{d-1})\)</span> is said to be <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span>-<em>cyclic</em> if <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}^\dagger(P_k)=P_{k-1\mod(d)}\)</span>. The suppremum over <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>’s such that an <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span>-cyclic resolution of the identity of cardinal <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> exists is precisely the period of <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span>. This characterization of the period can be better understood in the Heisenberg picture whereas the original definition is to be understood un the Schrödinger picture. The following lemma presents a useful characterization of reachable space starting from a state within an aperiodic subspace.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> be a quantum Markov chain and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> a subspace of <span class="math inline">\(cH\)</span>. Then the following statements are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is an aperiodic subspace of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For any <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in{{\cal D}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}(\rho)\subseteq X\)</span>, there exists an integer <span class="math inline">\(M(\rho)&gt;0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^m(\rho))={{\cal R}}_{({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})}(\rho)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n\ge M(\rho)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In particular if <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> is irreducible and aperiodic then for any <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in{{\cal D}}({{\cal H}})\)</span> there exists an integer <span class="math inline">\(M(\rho)&gt;0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^m(\rho))={{\cal H}}\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m\ge M(\rho)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The above result shows that starting from any state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, an irreducible and aperiodic quantum Markov chain can reach the whole space after a finite number of steps. Then it is interesting to see when the whole space can be reached for the first time. In order to do so define for an irreducible and aperiodic quantum Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> its <em>saturation time</em> <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to be <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                    s(\rho):=\inf\{ n\ge 1~|~ {\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^n(\rho))={{\cal H}}\}.
                    \end{aligned}\]</span> This infimum can always be attained from the last result. The next theorem, which gives a characterization of irreducibility and aperiodicity, states that the saturation time for any initial state has a universal upper bound:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> be a quantum Markov chain and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be an invariant subspace of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. Then the following statements are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}}|_{X})\)</span> is irreducible and aperiodic</p></li>
<li><p>There exists an integer <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(\rho\in{{\cal D}}(X)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}({{\cal E}}^m(\rho))=X\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m\ge M\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a direct application of the above theorem, taking <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to be the whole space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>, one can verify using that a quantum Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic if and only if it is primitive. Then a limit theorem can be easily obtained:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> be a quantum Markov chain. Then the following statements are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> has a limiting state <span class="math inline">\(\rho^*\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\({\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits}(\rho^*)={{\cal H}}\)</span> in the sense that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                    \lim_n {{\cal E}}^n(\rho)=\rho^*~~~\forall \rho\in{{\cal D}}({{\cal H}}).
                                    \end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> is irreducible and aperiodic</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is the only eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> with magnitude one and the corresponding eigenvector is <span class="math inline">\(\rho^*&gt;0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The next theorem shows that the period of an irreducible quantum Markov chain is exactly the number of the eigenvalues of the superoperator <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> with magnitude one.</p>
<p>The period of an irreducible quantum Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> equals the number of eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> with magnitude one.</p>
<p>The proof of the last theorem actually provides with a decomposition technique for irreducible Markov chains:</p>
<p>[7] The state space of an irreducible quantum Markov chain <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> can be decomposed into the direct sum of some orthogonal subspaces: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                                {{\cal H}}=B_0\oplus \dots\oplus B_{d-1}
                                \end{aligned}\]</span> with the following properties</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}(B_{i-1\mod d})=B_i\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((B_i,{{\cal E}}|_{B_i})\)</span> is irreducible and aperiodic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(B_i\)</span>’s are mutually orthogonal subspaces of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> and invariant under <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}^d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> being the period oc <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="limit-theorem-and-decomposition-for-generic-quantum-markov-chain" class="unnumbered">Limit theorem and decomposition for generic quantum Markov chain</h2>
<p>Here we consider general quantum Markov chains thatn might not be aperiodic or irreducible.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(({{\cal H}},{{\cal E}})\)</span> be a quantum Markov chain, and <span class="math inline">\(\{A_i\}_{i=1}^d\)</span> be an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=1\)</span> with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product.

<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is the only eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal E}}\)</span> with magnitude one.</p></li>

<p>The following theorem considers the case when the limiting state is unique.</p>

<p>It was proven in <span class="citation"></span> that although the BSCC decomposition of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is not unique, the number of BSCCs for different decompositions are the same.

<h1 id="open-quantum-random-walks">Open quantum random walks</h1>
<p>In 2014, Attal, Petruccione, Sabot and Sinayskiy introduced a new model of quantum random walks on lattices as well as on finite graphs . These quantum random walks take into account the behavior of open quantum systems. Then are the exact quantum analogues of classical Markov chains. Measuring the position of the particle after each time step gives rise to a classical Markov chain on the lattice times the state space of the particle. This quantum trajectory is a simulation of the master equation of the quantum random walk. This new type of quantum walks is very different form the one, denoted as <em>Unitary Quantum walks</em>, originally defined by Kempe . Even though physical implementation of any quantum concept is usually difficult due to unavoidable dissipation and decoherence effects, experimental realizations of unitary quantum random walks have been reported (). The formalism suggested here is rather is similar to the formalism of quantum Markov chains () The formalism of the open quantum random walks includes the classical random walk and through a physical realization procedure a connection to the unitary walk is established. Its particular properties makes it a promising candidate for modelling of quantum efficiency in biological systems and quantum computing.</p>
<h2 id="general-setup">General setup</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> a (finite or countable) set of vertices. Consider all the oriented edges <span class="math inline">\(\{(i,j); i,j\in {{\cal V}}\}\)</span>. We wish to give a quantum analogue of a random walk on the associated graph (or lattice). Consider the space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}:= \CC^{{\cal V}}\)</span>, i.e. the state space of a quantum system with as many degrees of freedom as the number of vertices. . When <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> is infinite countable we put <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}\)</span> to be any separable Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis indexed by <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span>. Fix such an orthonormal basis which we shall denote by <span class="math inline">\(\{|i\rangle\}_{i\in {{\cal V}}}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> be a separable Hilbert space; it stands for the space of degrees of freedom (or chirality) given at each point of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span>. Consider the space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span>. For each edge <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> fix a bounded operator <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. This operator stands for the effect of passing from <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Assume that for each <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \sum_i (B_j^i)^*B_j^i=I\end{aligned}\]</span> where the above series is strongly convergent (if infinite). This constraint can be understood as follows: the sum of all the effects leaving the site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is I. It is the same idea as the one for transition matrices associated to Markov chains: “the sum of all the probabilities leaving a site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>”. To each <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is therefore associated a CP map on the density matrices of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> of associated Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{M}_j(\rho)=\sum_i B_j^i \rho B_j^{i*}.\end{aligned}\]</span> The operators <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span> acting on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> only, we dilate them as operators on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> by putting: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    M_j^i:=B_j^i\otimes |i\rangle \langle j|.\end{aligned}\]</span> These operators encode exactly the idea that while passing from <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> on the lattice the effect is the operator <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. The series <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i,j} M_j^{i*} M_j^i\)</span> converges strongly to the operator <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. As a consequence the set of operators <span class="math inline">\(M_j^i\)</span> also encode a CP map on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> of the form: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{M}(\rho):=\sum_{ij} M_j^i \rho M_j^{i*}.\end{aligned}\]</span> Now starting from any density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span>, it is easy to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}(\rho)\)</span> is of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{cqstate}
    \sum_i \rho_i \otimes |i\rangle\langle i|
    \end{aligned}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span> trace class operators such that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \sum_i  {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(\rho_i)=1
    \end{aligned}\]</span> The state of the form [cqstate] are mixtures of initial states <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span> on each site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, but they express no mixing between the sites. Moreover if <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a state on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> of the form given in [cqstate], then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                \mathcal{M}(\rho)=\sum_i \left( \sum_j B_i^{j} \rho_j B_j^{i*}\right)\otimes |i\rangle \langle i|.
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>This is exactly the quantum analogue of a usual random walk: after one step on the site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> we have all the contributions from those pieces of the state which have traveled from <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Suppose now that we start by a state of the form [cqstate], then a measurement of the position in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}\)</span>, that is a measurement along the orthonormal basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|i\rangle\}_{i\in {{\cal V}}}\)</span>, gives the value <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> with probability <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(\rho_i).\end{aligned}\]</span> Applying the CP map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> once, the probability of the walk to occupy site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is then given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \sum_j {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(B_j^i\rho_j B_j^{i*}).
        \end{aligned}\]</span> After two steps this probability is updated into: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \sum_j \sum_k {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(B_j^i B_k^j \rho_k B_k^{j*} B_j^{i*}).
            \end{aligned}\]</span> In general this probability cannot be derived from the probability at the previous step as it would be the case for a classical Markov chain. One needs to know the density matrices <span class="math inline">\(\rho_k\)</span>. Contrary to the classical case where there are no internal degrees of freedom, the rules for jumping a site to another are here dictated by the sites, but also the spin state. This is what is called an <em>open quantum random walk</em>. As we saw, the states <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i^{(n)}\)</span> are updated at each step as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \rho_i^{(n+1)} =\sum_j B_j^i\rho_j^{(n)} B_j^{i*}.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> For each <span class="math inline">\(n\ge  1\)</span> the quantities <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    p_i^{(n)}:={\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(\rho_i^{(n)}),~~ i\in {{\cal V}}\end{aligned}\]</span> define a probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p^{(n)}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span>, it is called the <em>probability distribution of the open quantum random walk at time <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></em>. A few examples have been treated in (on <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>, on graphs) for the case of <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span> central limit theorems have been proved (see ).</p>
<h2 id="recovering-classical-markov-chains">Recovering classical Markov chains</h2>
<p>It is interesting to notice that all the classical Markov chains (homogeneous or non homogeneous) can be recovered as particular cases of open quantum random walks.

<h2 id="quantum-trajectories">Quantum trajectories</h2>
<p>A convinient way to simulate open quantum random walks is by means of quantum trajectories. This property seems very important when one wants to study the limit behavior of these quantum random walks (see ). The principle of quantum trajectories associated to an open quantum random walk is the following: starting from any initial state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> we apply the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> and then a measurement of the position in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}\)</span>. We end up with a random result for the measurement and a reduction of the wave-packet gives rise to a random state on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \rho_i\otimes |i\rangle\langle i|.\end{aligned}\]</span> We then apply the procedure again: an action of the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> and a measurement of the position in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}\)</span>. By repeatedly applying the CP map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> and a measurement of the position on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}\)</span>, one obtains a sequence of random states on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span>. This sequence is a non-homogeneous Markov chain with law being described as follows. If the sate of the chain at time <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\rho\otimes |j\rangle\langle j|\)</span>, then at time <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> it jumps to one of the values <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{p(i)} B_j^{i}\rho B_j^{i*} \otimes |i\rangle\langle i|,~~i\in{{\cal V}},
    \end{aligned}\]</span> with probability <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    p(i)= {\mathop{\rm Tr}\nolimits}(B_j^i\rho B_j^{i*}).
    \end{aligned}\]</span> This Markov chain <span class="math inline">\((\rho^{n})\)</span> is a simulation of the master equation driven by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>, that is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \EE[\rho^{(n+1)}|\rho^{(n)}]=\mathcal{M}(\rho^{(n)}).
        \end{aligned}\]</span> Furthermore if the initial state is a pure state, then the quantum trajectory stays valued in pure states and the Markov chain is described as follows. If the state if the chain at time <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the pure state <span class="math inline">\(|\varphi\rangle \otimes |k\rangle\)</span>, then at time <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> it jumps to one of the values <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{p(i)} B_j^i |\varphi\rangle \otimes |i\rangle,~~i\in\mathcal{V},
    \end{aligned}\]</span> with probability <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        p(i)=\| B_j^i|\varphi\rangle\|^2.
        \end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<p>Consider an open random walk on a finite number of vertices <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> with finite chirality space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> and associated transition operators <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span>. There exists a unitary operator <span class="math inline">\(U(j)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> whose first column (choose <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>) is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            U_1^i(j)=B_j^i.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> This unitary operator is a unitary that dilates the CP map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_j\)</span> defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \mathcal{M}_j(\rho)=\sum_i B_j^i \rho B_j^{i*}.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> In other words, the CP map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_j\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> is the partial trace of some unitary interaction between <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> and some environment <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>. It is well-known that the dimension can be chosen to be the same as the number of Krauss operators appearing in the decomposition of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_j\)</span>. Hence the environment can be chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}={{\cal K}}\)</span>. The state space on which one performs the realization procedure is <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}_1\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_2\)</span> are two copies of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}\)</span>. Each unitary operator <span class="math inline">\(U(j)\)</span> defined above acts on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}_1\)</span>. The unitary operator <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    U= \sum_j U(j)\otimes |j\rangle\langle j|
    \end{aligned}\]</span> acts now on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}_1\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span>. Define the so-called <em>swap operator</em> <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    S(|j\rangle \otimes |k\rangle)=|k\rangle \otimes |j\rangle.
    \end{aligned}\]</span> It is a unitary operator on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span> which simply expresses the fact of exchanging the two systems <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_2\)</span>. We shall use a <em>decoherence procedure</em> on the space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span>. along the basis <span class="math inline">\((|i\rangle)\)</span>. By this we mean the following: if the systen is in a superposition of pure states <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    |\varphi\rangle =\sum_i \lambda_i |i\rangle,
    \end{aligned}\]</span> then this system is coupled to an environment in sich a way and in a sufficiently long time, for the state of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> to become <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \sum_i |\lambda_i |^2 |i\rangle\langle i|.
        \end{aligned}\]</span> This is to say that we have chosen a coupling of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> with some environment which makes the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix <span class="math inline">\(|\varphi\rangle \langle \varphi|\)</span> converge exponentially fast to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. This kind of decoherence is now well-known in physics. It is rather easy to describe an environment and an explicit Hamiltonian which will produce such a result (see and also ). Finally, we shall need a <em>refreshing procedure</em>, that is, if <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> is in any state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> then we put it back to the state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\langle 1|\)</span>. By this we mean either that the system <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> is taken away and re-prepared in the state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\langle 1|\)</span>, or that a new copy of <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\langle 1|\)</span> is brought into the game in order to replace the old copy, which will play no role anymore (see for theoretical setup or for concrete experiments).</p>
<p>[propr1]Consider the quantum system <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}_1\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span>, together with some initial state <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \rho^{(0)}=\sum_k \rho_k\otimes |1\rangle\langle 1|\otimes |k\rangle\rangle k|.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> If we perform successively</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An action of the unitary <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>a decoherence on the basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|i\rangle\}\)</span> of the system <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>an action of the swap operator <span class="math inline">\(I\otimes S\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>a refreshing of the system <span class="math inline">\({{\cal K}}_1\)</span> to the state <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\langle 1|\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>then the state of the system becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                    \sum_k \left(\sum_l   B_l^k\rho_l B_l^{k*} \right)\otimes |1\rangle\langle 1|\otimes |k\rangle\langle k|.
                    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>That is, one reads the first step of the dissipative quantum random walk on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span>. By iterating this whole procedure one produces the dissipative quantum random walk on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}_2\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="link-to-unitary-quantum-random-walks">Link to unitary quantum random walks</h2>
<p>The open quantum random walks are actually very different from the well-known unitary quantum random walks such as the Hadamard random walk . They produce probability distribution which are not of the same type as the ones usually observed with Hadamard quantum random walks. The limit behaviors of open quantum random walks seems to be all Gaussian or mixtures of Gaussians, which is very different from their unitary counterparts. However there is quite a surprising and strong link between the two types of quantum random walks which appear via the physical realization procedure presented just above. Under some conditions on the <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span>’s by modifying this procedure one can produce the usual unitary quantum walks: let’s <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> be s et of vertices, let <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span> be a Hilbert space representing the chirality. For each pair <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}^2\)</span> we have a bounded operator <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. Instead of the usual condition <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    B_j^{i*} B_j^i =I
    \end{aligned}\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, we shall ask here a much stronger condition, namely that for all <span class="math inline">\(j,j&#39;\in{{\cal V}}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{restr}
        \sum_i B_j^{i*} B_{j&#39;}^i = \delta_{j j&#39;}I.
        \end{aligned}\]</span> In other words, being given two starting points <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j&#39;\)</span>, the sum of the “contributions” which go to the same points <span class="math inline">\(i\in {{\cal V}}\)</span> vanish, unless <span class="math inline">\(j=j&#39;\)</span> in which case we recover the usual condition. Note that there is no analogue of this condition for classical Markov matrices. With this additional condition, if we are given a pure state on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\otimes {{\cal K}}\)</span> of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            |\psi\rangle=\sum_i |\varphi_i\rangle \otimes |i\rangle
            \end{aligned}\]</span> with the condition <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                \|\psi\|^2=\sum_i \|\varphi_i\|^2=1
                \end{aligned}\]</span> then the state <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
                    |\psi&#39;\rangle = \sum_i \left( \sum_j B_j^i |\varphi_j\rangle\right)\otimes |i\rangle\end{aligned}\]</span> is of the same form and satisfies <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \|\psi&#39;\|^2&amp;=\sum_i \sum_{jj&#39;} \langle \varphi_j, B_j^{i*} B_{j&#39;}^{i}\varphi_{j&#39;}\rangle\\
    &amp;=\sum_{jj&#39;}\langle \varphi_j,\delta_{jj&#39;} I\varphi_{j&#39;}\rangle=\sum_j \|\varphi_j\|^2=1.
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Hence at each step we get a state of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        |\psi\rangle = \sum_i |\varphi_i\rangle \otimes |i\rangle
    \end{aligned}\]</span> with the condition <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \|\psi\|^2=\sum_i \|\varphi_i\|^2=1.
        \end{aligned}\]</span> In particular it determines at each step a probability distribution on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> by putting <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            P(i)=\||\varphi_i\|^2.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> This is exactly the picture for the unitary quantum random walks, such as the Hadamard quantum random walk. Now the interesting point is the way one can physically realize such unitary quantum random walks and the way this construction is similar to the one of ope quantum random walks.</p>
<p>If the transition operators <span class="math inline">\(B_j^i\)</span> satisfy the more restrictive condition [restr], then applying the same physical procedure as in without the decoherence step gives rise to a unitary quantum random walk.</p>

<p>In some properties of classical Markov chain have been extended to the framework of Attal et al. They first generalized the definition of an open quantum random walk to walks on <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j\in {{\cal V}}} {{\cal H}}_j\)</span>, allowing therefore the spins at each vertex to live in a different separable Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this, and in the following sections, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is assumed to be a positive map on the ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_1({{\cal H}})\)</span> of trace class operators on some Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>. Such a map is automatically bounded as a linear map on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_1({{\cal H}})\)</span> (). The positive map <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is called</p>

</ul>
<p>The condition <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(P\mathcal{T}_1({{\cal H}}) P)\subset P {{\cal T}}_1({{\cal H}}) \)</span> is equivalent to the condition <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(P)\le \alpha P\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&gt;0\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(P\in {{\cal T}}_1({{\cal H}})\)</span> i.e. whenever <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is finite dimensional. In the infinite dimensional case one cas prove that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> reduces <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> if and only if for any finite-dimensional projection <span class="math inline">\(Q\ge P\)</span> one has <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(Q)\le \alpha Q\)</span>. Ergodicity for some <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> implies ergodicity for any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. One could define similar notions in the Heisenberg picture (and it is being done in the litterature, ). The notions in the Schrodinger picture and the Heisenberg picture are closely related (see Proposition 3.4 of ) Irreducibility and ergodicity (in the Schrodinger picture) are equivalent, as proved in . Consider now a CPTP map with Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\((A_k)_{k\in K}\)</span> such that: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<p>A CP map <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> of the form [kraus] is</p>

<li><p>irreducible iff for any <span class="math inline">\(\phi\in{{\cal H}}\backslash\{0\}\)</span>, the set <span class="math inline">\(\CC[A]\phi\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\CC[A]\)</span> denotes the set of polynomials in <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>, is dense in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}\)</span>.</p></li>

<p>For any <span class="math inline">\(i,j\in{{\cal V}}\)</span> call a <em>path</em> from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> any finite sequence <span class="math inline">\(i_0,\dots i_l\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(l\ge 1\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(i_0=i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i_l=j\)</span>. Such a path is said to be of <em>length</em> <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. We denote by <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal{P}}(i,j)\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal{P}}_l(i,j)\)</span>) the set of paths from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of arbitrary length (resp. length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>). A path from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will be called a loop; by convention we consider the sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{i\}\)</span> as a loop (with length one), i.e. an element of <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal{P}}(i,i)\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\pi=(i_0,\dots, i_l)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal{P}}(i,j)\)</span> we denote by <span class="math inline">\(B_\pi\)</span> the element from <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\({{\cal H}}_j\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<p>The CPTP map <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is irreducible iff for every <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span>, one of the following equivalent conditions holds:</p>

</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> be an open quantum random walk. We say that two sites <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\({{\cal V}}\)</span> are <em>connected</em> by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>, which we denote by <span class="math inline">\(i\overset{\mathcal{M}}{\to} j\)</span>, if one of the equivalent conditions of the last proposition holds. As we have shown, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is irreducible if and only if, for any two <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span>, one has <span class="math inline">\(i\overset{\mathcal{M}}{\to} j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j \overset{\mathcal{M}}{\to} i\)</span>.</p>
<p>A minimal dilation of a classical Markov chain is irreducible if and only if the Markov chain is irreducible in the classical sense.</p>
<p>Assume that a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-positive map <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\({{\cal T}}_1({{\cal H}})\)</span> has an eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of modulus <span class="math inline">\(\|\Phi\|\)</span>, with eigenvector <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>.
